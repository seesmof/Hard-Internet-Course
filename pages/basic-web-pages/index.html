    <h1>Internet Is Easy?</h1>
    <p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML.</p>

    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>
      Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of headings
      out there.
    </p>

    <h2>Lists</h2>
    <p>This is how you make an unordered list:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Add a "ul" element - it stands for unordered list</li>
      <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
      <li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
    </ul>
    <p>And this is what an ordered list looks like:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
      <li>But, the list item elements are the same</li>
      <li>Also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
      <li>
        You should be noticing things is this precise order, because this is an
        ordered list
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Inline Elements</h2>
    <p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw attention</p>
    <p>
      Other times, you need to <strong>strong</strong>ly emphasize the
      importance of a word or a phrase
    </p>
    <p>
      <em><strong>And sometimes you need to shout!</strong></em>
    </p>

    <h2>Empty Elements</h2>
    <p>Thanks for reading! Interesting should be getting easier now.</p>

      P.S. This page might look like crap, but we'll fix that with some CSS
      soon!
