# Internet Is Easy?

This is a basic HTML file that demonstrates some of the fundamental concepts of web development. It contains various HTML elements such as headings, lists, and inline elements.

## Getting Started

To use this file, simply download or clone the repository to your local machine and open the index.html file in your web browser.

## HTML Elements

The following HTML elements are demonstrated in this file:

### Headings

Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of headings out there.

### Lists

This is how you make an unordered list:

- Add a ul element - it stands for unordered list
- Add each item in its own li element
- They don't need to be in any particular order

And this is what an ordered list looks like:

1. Notice the new ol element wrapping everything
2. But, the list item elements are the same
3. Also note how the numbers increment on their own
4. You should be noticing things is this precise order, because this is an ordered list

### Inline Elements

Sometimes, you need to draw attention. Other times, you need to strongly emphasize the importance of a word or a phrase. And sometimes you need to shout!

### Empty Elements

This file also demonstrates the use of empty elements such as hr and br.
